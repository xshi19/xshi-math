## Statement

The extreme-value index $\xi$ is the tail-shape parameter of an extreme-value
domain of attraction.  It is not defined by assuming a
[Pareto-type](./incerto-pareto.md) tail.  Let $H_\xi$ denote the
standardized generalized extreme-value (GEV)
CDF,

$$
H_\xi(z)=\exp\left[-(1+\xi z)^{-1/\xi}\right],
\qquad 1+\xi z>0,\quad \xi\ne0,
$$

with the Gumbel boundary case

$$
H_0(z)=\exp(-e^{-z}).
$$

The formula for $H_\xi$ is written on its support; outside the support it takes
the usual endpoint CDF values.  In the block-maxima view, if
$X_1,\dots,X_n$ are iid with distribution $F$, $M_n=\max_i X_i$, and there are
normalizing constants $a_n>0$ and $b_n$ such that, at every continuity point
$z$ of $H_\xi$,

$$
\mathbb P\left(\frac{M_n-b_n}{a_n}\le z\right)
\to
H_\xi(z),
$$

then $\xi$ is the extreme-value index of that tail.  The arrow $\to$ means
ordinary convergence of the CDF values at continuity points of $H_\xi$;
equivalently,
$(M_n-b_n)/a_n$ converges in distribution to a random variable with CDF
$H_\xi$.  The
[Pickands-Balkema-de Haan theorem](./incerto-pickands-balkema-de-haan.md)
then says that the same $\xi$ appears as the generalized Pareto shape
parameter in threshold-excess limits.

Estimating $\xi$ means choosing a tail region and reporting an estimate of
$\xi$ together with the sensitivity of that estimate to the threshold choice.
If a distribution is not in a stable extreme-value domain of attraction, then
there is no single population EVI for these estimators to target; fitted
values are finite-sample diagnostics rather than estimates of a well-defined
limit parameter.

For the positive, Frechet-type case, a common calibration is a
Pareto-type right tail with

$$
\bar F(x)=x^{-\alpha}L(x),\qquad \alpha>0,
$$

where $L$ is [slowly varying](./incerto-regular-variation.md), the
extreme-value index is

$$
\xi=\frac1\alpha>0.
$$

This Pareto-type formula is a special case, not the definition.  More
generally, $\xi>0$ corresponds to a heavy right tail with
Frechet-type limits, $\xi=0$ to the
Gumbel domain, and $\xi<0$ to a finite right endpoint. The Gumbel domain
includes both exponential and lognormal tails; $\xi=0$ does not require an
exactly exponential tail. These notes focus on $\xi>0$, often reported
through the reciprocal Pareto exponent $\alpha=1/\xi$.

Here $\bar F(x)=\mathbb P(X>x)$ and $L$ is slowly varying. The
standardized GEV CDF $H_\xi$, normalizing constants $a_n$, $b_n$, and
argument $z$ belong to the block-maxima statement; $k$ and $x_{i:n}$
are defined with the estimators below.

## Proving the exact Pareto calibration

We prove $\xi=1/\alpha$ for iid exact Pareto variables with $\alpha>0$ and
$x_m>0$. Set $c_n=x_m n^{1/\alpha}$. For $y\ge n^{-1/\alpha}$,
independence gives the exact finite-$n$ CDF

$$
P(M_n/c_n\le y)=\left(1-\frac{y^{-\alpha}}n\right)^n.
$$

Below that support boundary the CDF is zero. For each fixed $y>0$ the
displayed expression tends to $\exp(-y^{-\alpha})$ by
$n\log(1-y^{-\alpha}/n)\to-y^{-\alpha}$. The limit is zero for $y\le0$.
To match the GEV convention above, choose $b_n=c_n$ and $a_n=c_n/\alpha$.
Then $y=1+z/\alpha=1+\xi z$, and the limiting CDF is $H_{1/\alpha}(z)$.
This proves the claimed EVI for exact Pareto. The general regular-variation
characterization and the threshold-limit theorem are cited results, not
proved by this special case.

SCoFT v4 §2.2.22, p. 17, motivates the domain-of-attraction terminology
[@taleb2025scoftv4]. Approaching a support endpoint alone does not define a
maximum domain of attraction. If $x_F=\sup\{x:F(x)<1\}$, then iid sampling
gives $P(M_n\le r)=F(r)^n\to0$ for every $r<x_F$, even without a
nondegenerate normalized limit. The EVI definition needs that additional
limit and its normalizing constants.

Use [`pareto_normalized_maximum_cdf`](incerto-api-reference.md#api-pareto-normalized-maximum-cdf).

```python
import numpy as np
from xmath.incerto.glossary import pareto_normalized_maximum_cdf

y = [0.5, 1, 2]
for n in (1, 4, 16, 64):
    print(n, pareto_normalized_maximum_cdf(y, alpha=1.5, n=n).round(4))
print("Frechet limit:", np.exp(-np.array(y)**-1.5).round(4))
```

**Output**

```text
1 [0.     0.     0.6464]
4 [0.0074 0.3164 0.6906]
16 [0.0445 0.3561 0.6994]
64 [0.0554 0.365  0.7015]
Frechet limit: [0.0591 0.3679 0.7022]
```

These finite-$n$ CDFs are population calculations, not estimates from sampled maxima.

`uv run python demos/incerto/glossary_worked_cases.py` compares the exact
CDFs for $\alpha=3/2$, $n=1,4,16,64$, with the Fréchet limit on a fixed
positive grid. These are population CDF evaluations, not fits to simulated
maxima. The [Pareto excess calculation](incerto-pareto.md#pareto-threshold-quantities)
also derives the exact GPD shape $1/\alpha$ by a conditional probability
ratio, without invoking a general limit theorem.

## Tail-coordinate intuition

Here "coordinate" means a one-dimensional tail coordinate, not a two-dimensional
$(x,y)$ coordinate system.  The parameter $\xi$ puts several tail descriptions
on the same scalar scale.  In a [Pareto tail](./incerto-pareto.md), it
is just the inverse of the familiar tail exponent: smaller $\alpha$ means
larger $\xi$ and heavier extremes.  For non-Pareto domains, $\xi$ is still the
GEV/GPD shape coordinate: $\xi=0$ describes the Gumbel boundary and $\xi<0$
describes finite-endpoint tails.  There is then no reciprocal Pareto exponent
$\alpha=1/\xi$ to report.

The logical order is therefore not circular.  First, a distribution may belong
to an extreme-value domain of attraction with index $\xi$.  Second, the
Pickands-Balkema-de Haan theorem transfers that same $\xi$ to the
peaks-over-threshold generalized Pareto limit.  Third, exact Pareto and
Pareto-type tails provide a convenient $\xi=1/\alpha$ calibration for the
positive-tail case.

In a generalized Pareto approximation for threshold excesses, the same $\xi$
is the shape parameter that controls whether excesses look heavy-tailed,
exponential-like, or endpoint-bounded.

That makes EVI estimation useful because many downstream questions are really
questions about $\xi$: Do moments exist?  Are threshold exceedances plausibly
Pareto-like?  Is a Hill estimate stable across a range of $k$?  Is a fitted
peaks-over-threshold model trying to put the sample in the $\xi\ge1$ infinite
mean region, the $1/2\le\xi<1$ finite-mean but infinite-variance region, or a
thinner regime? These moment boundaries are exact for a GPD model. For a
general regularly varying tail, the boundary cases also depend on the slowly
varying factor, as explained by [Karamata](./incerto-karamata.md).

The danger is that $\xi$ is a tail parameter, while data are finite and mostly
not tail.  Choosing the threshold too high gives little data and high variance.
Choosing it too low mixes body observations into a tail calculation.

## Estimator connections

For a realized positive right-tail sample
$x_{1:n}\le \cdots \le x_{n:n}$, the Hill estimate is

$$
\widehat\xi_{k,n}^{H}
=
\frac1k\sum_{j=1}^{k}
\log\left(\frac{x_{n-j+1:n}}{x_{n-k:n}}\right),
\qquad 1\le k<n.
$$

The value of $k$ selects the number of upper order statistics.  An EVI estimate
should therefore be reported as a threshold-indexed diagnostic, not as a
threshold-free constant.

The same tail coordinate appears in threshold-excess modeling.  Under the
conditions of the
Pickands-Balkema-de Haan theorem, cited in the references below,
for high thresholds $u$ the excess $X-u\mid X>u$ is approximated by a
generalized Pareto distribution with shape $\xi$ and scale $\beta(u)>0$.
Fitting that shape parameter across several thresholds is another way to
estimate or diagnose the extreme-value index.

## Diagnostic comparison

The three sign regimes have simple generalized Pareto representatives. An
exact Pareto calibration then connects Hill and GPD shape estimates.

(extreme-value-index-diagnostic-comparison)=
With GPD scale $\beta=1$, three exact survival functions illustrate the
sign regimes:

| $\xi$ | Survival at excess $y$ | Support |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $-1/4$ | $(1-y/4)^4$ | $0\le y\le4$ |
| $0$ | $e^{-y}$ | $y\ge0$ |
| $1/2$ | $(1+y/2)^{-2}$ | $y\ge0$ |

For exact Pareto with $\alpha=1.6$, Hill targets $\xi=1/1.6=0.625$.
The exact distribution of excesses above any $u\ge x_m$ is GPD with
that same shape and scale $u/1.6$. This is a population calibration;
sample fits may disagree and depend on the chosen threshold.

Positive $\xi$ leaves a power tail, $\xi=0$ gives exponential GPD
excesses, and negative $\xi$ ends at a finite endpoint. Agreement between
finite-sample estimates would be a diagnostic, not proof of the tail model.

## Caveats

- EVI estimation is threshold-sensitive.  Report the chosen $k$ or threshold
  $u$, the sample transformation, and a stability diagnostic.
- Hill estimates are designed for positive right-tail data and $\xi>0$.
  They should not be used blindly for two-sided returns, zero-heavy data,
  exponential-type tails, or finite-endpoint tails.
- A stable region is not proof of a Pareto model.  Dependence, volatility
  clustering, mixtures, truncation, censoring, and measurement limits can all
  distort the apparent tail index.
- The reciprocal $\widehat\alpha=1/\widehat\xi$ is unstable when
  $\widehat\xi$ is close to zero.  Moment claims near $\xi=1$ or $\xi=1/2$
  need special caution.
- The GPD shape parameter is asymptotic in the threshold.  A fitted value from
  one finite threshold is a model diagnostic, not a theorem about the data.
